## Testing [4]

### Feature Testing [4.i]

**eProsima Micro CDR** provides tests which simulate typical usage, and they are located in the [`test` directory](test).
New features are required to have tests before being added as stated in [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).
Current nightly results can be found here:

* Linux [![Linux ci](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/view/Nightly/job/Micro-CDR%20Nightly%20Master%20Linux/badge/icon?subject=%20%20%20Linux%20CI%20)](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/view/Micro%20XRCE/job/Micro-CDR%20Nightly%20Master%20Linux/)
* Windows [![Windows ci](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/job/Micro-CDR%20Nightly%20Master%20Windows/badge/icon?subject=%20%20%20%20Windows%20CI%20)](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/view/Micro%20XRCE/job/Micro-CDR%20Nightly%20Master%20Windows/)

### Public API Testing [4.ii]

Each part of the public API has tests, and new additions or changes to the public API require tests before being added.
The tests aim to cover typical usage and corner cases.

### Coverage [4.iii]

[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/jenkins/coverage/cobertura?jobUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fjenkins.eprosima.com%3A8080%2Fview%2FMicro%2520XRCE%2Fjob%2FMicro-CDR%2520Nightly%2520Master%2520Linux%2F)](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/view/Micro%20XRCE/job/Micro-CDR%20Nightly%20Master%20Linux/)
*eProsima Micro CDR* aims to provide a line coverage **above 90%**.
*Micro CDR* code coverage policy comprises:
1. All contributions to *Micro CDR* must increase (or at least keep) current line coverage.
   This is done to ensure that the **90%** line coverage goal is eventually met.
1. Line coverage regressions are only permitted if properly justified and accepted by maintainers.
1. If the CI system reports a coverage regression after a pull request has been merged, the maintainers must study the case and decide how to proceed, mostly reverting the changes and asking for a more thorough testing of the committed changes.
2. This policy is enforced through the [nightly Micro CDR CI job](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/view/Micro%20XRCE/job/Micro-CDR%20Nightly%20Master%20Linux/).

As stated in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), developers and contributors are asked to run a line coverage assessment locally before submitting a PR.

### Performance [4.iv]

**eProsima Micro CDR** does not provide performance tests.
However, performance is indirectly tested by *eprosima Micro XRCE-DDS Client*.

Any performance regression detected in *eprosima Micro XRCE-DDS Client* would be analyzed and, in case that it is related to **eProsima Micro CDR** or could be solved modifying this library, changes could be made to the library in order to revert the performance regression.

### Linters and Static Analysis [4.v]


TODO: uncrustify, check Synopsis and CodeQL

<!-- **eProsima Micro CDR** [code style](https://github.com/eProsima/cpp-style) is enforced using [*uncrustify*](https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify).
Among the CI tests there are tests that ensures that every pull request is compliant with the code style.
The latest pull request results can be seen [here](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/job/fastcdr_github_uncrustify/lastBuild/).
The tests only check files where changes have been made.
Therefore, the code style is only enforced in some files.
However, the tendency will be to homogenize the older source files to the code style. -->

**eProsima Micro CDR** uses [Synopsis Coverity static code analysis](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/eprosima-micro-cdr).

**eProsima Micro CDR** uses [CodeQL](https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-CDR/security/code-scanning?query=tool%3ACodeQL) to find security issues on the code.

## Dependencies [5]

### Direct Runtime Dependencies [5.iii]

**eProsima Micro CDR** has no run-time or build-time dependencies that need to be considered for this declaration.

## Platform Support [6]

**eProsima Micro CDR** supports the following platforms and tests each change against all of them as can be seen in the current nightly results:
